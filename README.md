DreymaR's Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks
====================================

### For keyboard controllers/converters such as the USB-2-USB QUICKIE<sup>[¤](#QICO)</sup>, using [Hasu's TMK][TMKG]

* "Extend" layers using Caps Lock as a modifier for navigation/editing from the home position and more
* Angle/Wide ergo modifications to improve wrist angles, hand spacing and right pinky stretch/load effort
* Curl-DH ergo modifications to encourage natural finger curvature (only for Colemak as of now)
* The 4 Tarmak transitional Colemak layouts for learning Colemak or Colemak-Curl in smaller steps if desired
* Mirrored Colemak that allows one-handed typing (normally used as second layout with a switch key)

More info
---------

* Run the enclosed MakeFlash script with -h for more help and info.
* The MakeFlash script can install the needed AVR tools for Linux, and Git plus TMK before building/flashing.
* The install switches (-a and -g) can also update existing tools/TMK.
* If you already have TMK, my dir should be placed within or beside the tmk_keyboard dir.
* Alternatively, the contents of my dir could be placed directly in the tmk_keyboard dir.
* The hexfile folder holds precompiled .hex binaries, most for the USB-2-USB converter; new backups may also go there.
* The unimaps folder holds universal keymaps suitable for all controllers.

See the [DreymaR's Big Bag (USB-2-USB) topic][DBBU] on the [Colemak Forums][CMKF].
There are plenty of explanations and further links in there.

Also, obviously the [main TMK GitHub repo][TMKG].


_Happy TMK hacking!_
